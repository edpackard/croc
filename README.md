This is an attempt to implement the notorious Croc game from Makers pre-course in simple JavaScript.

This was a silly weekend effort, messing around with DOM manipulation and some basic CSS. No test driving of code I'm afraid.

# How to install this program

```
git clone https://github.com/edpackard/croc.git
cd croc
open index.html
```

# How to play

Click the buttons to move the swimmer: you can move left, right or go straight on.

This really isn't a very exciting game - you have to navigate the river of crocodiles and get safely to the bottom of the screen. Bear in mind that the current will move you one step 'forward' every time you make a move.

The purpose of the game in the Makers pre-course was to test our skills with arrays: it has a bit of a mythical status, so I thought it would be fun to add simple graphics and try the logic in JavaScript.
